    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil (coconut oil may be substituted)</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced small</li>
        <li>1.25 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger or 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 to 4 tablespoons Mekhala Organic Yellow Curry Paste</li>
        <li>13.5-ounce can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/3 cup fresh cilantro or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 to 4 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>salt, optional and to taste</li>
        <li>rice (jasmine or basmati) or naan, optional for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p> To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and sauté over medium-high 
            heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; 
            stir intermittently.</p></li>

        <li><p>Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, 
            or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.</p></li>

        <li><p>Add the garlic, turmeric, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, 
            or until fragrant; stir frequently.</p></li>

        <li><p>Add the curry paste, coconut milk, carrots, and stir to combine. 
            Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 
            5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and 
            thickens slightly.</p></li>

        <li><p>Add the spinach, pepper, and stir until the spinach has wilted.</p></li>

        <li><p>Taste the curry and add the optional but recommended lime juice 
            (brightens the flavor of the dish), cilantro, optional light brown sugar 
            (balances the heat), optional salt (I did not add any because the curry 
            paste has salt in it), and add extra of any of the spices already used or 
            more curry paste, if desired and to taste.</p></li>
    </ol>
